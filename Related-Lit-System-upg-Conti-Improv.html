            <center><h2>Related Literature - System Upgrade and Continous Improvement</h2></center>
            <p>The  pandemic  crisis  brought  a  multitude  of  challenges  in  every  higher  educational  institution sincethe national  government  imposed different  restrictions  and  health  protocols.  Hence,  this study aimed to determine the predicaments, situations, and experiences of students specifically in terms of the online enrollment process of Nueva Ecija University ofScience and Technology for the academic year 2020-2021.</p>
            <p>The researchers of this study used a descriptive method of research  to  assess  the  feedback  of  1,078  students  in  terms  of  the  system's  functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability. At the same time, this study was conducted  to  identify  the  level  of  qualities  the  system  can  provide  to  the  university's stakeholders  and  to  determine  the  technical  loopholes  and  attribute  that  requires  updating  to satisfy  the  university's  clientele-the  students.  The  results  have  shown  thatthe  students  foundthe system  particularlygood  in  terms  of  its  functionality,  reliability,  usability,  efficiency, maintainability,  and  portability  and  only  good  concerning  its  efficiency.  This  means that  the system provides an elevatedlevel of quality and requires minimal rectifications for improvement. In  that  case,  the  researchers  suggested  improving  the  system  in  terms  of  efficiency  which  is about  the  use  of  input  to  produce  a  quality  and  highest amount  of  output.</p>
            <p>Finally,  the researchers  suggested  conducting  future  studies  wherein  the  system  will  be  assessed  by Technical  Experts  in  terms  of  technical  aspects  of  the  system  which  is  based  on  ISO/IEC 25010:2011  or  software  quality standards.  <i><u>(Jennilyn,  Romeo,  Ellen  Jane,  Marvin,  Rhoel Anthony,  2021)</u></i>. findings  and  conclusion,  the  system  is  easy  to  understand;  easy  to  learn  by different  users e.g.,beginner,  expert;  the  system  can  be  opened  in  different  browser  e.g.,Internet   Explorer,   Google   Chrome,   Mozilla   Firefox.   The   Systems   support   the   different language/dialect;  the  system  can  be  open  on  different  devices.  In  terms  of  the  system’s, functionality, it can be concluded that the intended purpose as an online enrollment system was captured  by  the  system. </p>
            <p>The  system’s overall functionality,  asviewed  by  the student’s,  is laudable with emphasis on student’s registration and enrolling in the right subjects.  For  the system’s  reliability,  it  can  be concluded  that  the  system  is  reliable  in  terms  of  failure  andrecovery factors. As per observation by the students, the system availability after experiencing failure is commendable.It can be concluded from the system’s usability,  that the system can easily  be  used  with  different  internet  browser  was  highly  praised  by  the  students;  In  the systems  efficiency,  it  can  be  concluded  that  some  aspects  are  still  in  need  of  updating  and improvement for the system to be perceived as more efficient by the users; with the system’s maintainable  being  highly  commended  by  the  students  particularly  in  terms  of  modification  of the system easily by the technical support team; and for the system’s portability, it can be 
                concluded  that  the  system  is  portable  as  viewed  by  the  students  specifically  the  capability  of the system to be opened on different devices.</p>
