            <p>As  citizen  of  Information  Age,  we  store  and  access  everything.  Virtually  all  aspects  of Information are recorded and processed by a computer. This information is valuable resource and  must  be  secured  properly  so  that  it  does  not  fall  into  the  wrong  hands. The  personal information  stored on  your computer  is  valuable  enough  to  protect  and  security  is  an  issue  to everyone.<i><u>(Bob, 2010)</u></i>.</p>
            <p>Thefinding and conclusion on this research areto protect and lock the credential  of  the  users  in  which  we  can  trust  the  system;  a lot  of  disturbancescould happenand bother for each users but sometimes we need toallow or disallow the information; the two choices werebe  made  of;  such  instances  occurs;  to  open  or  close  the  system  privately;Information  Assurancecontains  all  the elements  of  information  security  (con-fidentiality)  but also includes elements of availability, and integrity.  Information as-assuranceprovides a view of information protectionthat  includes  defensive measuresin  all  three  states —processing, storage, and transmission.Security holds both national and inter-national attention; frequently, one  loses site  thatour  information  security  is  more than  physical.  Global  commerce  relies  on computersand  an  associated  electronic  infra-structure.  E-commerce,  business  to business, Internet, and e-mail are just a few of the tools that have entered the vocabulary ofthe end user in  the  past  decade. Many  individuals would  not  know  how  to make  theirlives  work  nor  their enterprise profit-able without these tools. Consider how much would your life change if you no longer had access to the internet and its services Now, expand your thinking to include those other  critical  functions  that  are  sup-ported  by  that  same  electronic infrastructure. Hospitals, airlines, power, food distribution, schools, libraries, agribusiness, manufacturingare a sample of critical in-formation infrastructure components that supporta modern economy and society. </p>
            <p>These systems have become so complex that no one understands all their interactions. This  complexity  combined with tightlycoupled  systems  operations createsfragile  critical systems.  In  these systems,  failure  of  a  single  component may  adverselyaffect  the  integrity, confidentiality, and availability of many critical systems.In addition,being fragile, they are brittle—they  may  break  unexpectedly into  ano  recoverable state.  Any  national or  international security effort cannot afford toplace the security of their economy and societyon the backs of fragile systems. Although languages and specifics may differby discipline, there is now general recognitionthat  information technology  securityis  a  core  business  process. Integralto establishing a core process is buildinga competent information technology securitywork force —a people-based counter measure.  This  security workforce  facilitates both  industry  and

The  multidimensional approach  dealswith  technologies  such  as biometrics, crypto graphic systems,  and  smart cards;  operationsissues  such as  HIPAA,  trans-border data flows,  procedures, software  propertyrights,  privacy, auditing,  person-manufacturingare  a sample  of  critical information infrastructure  components that  support a  modern  economy  and society.</p>
