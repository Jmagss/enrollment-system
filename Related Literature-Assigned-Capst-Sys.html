            <center><h2>Enrolment System</h2></center>
            <center>      <p>Online  student  enrollment  system  enables  students  to  enroll  into  their  subjects  prior  to  the commencement  of  their  semesters.  This  enrollment  system  not  only  allows  international students  to  enroll  through  internet  without  traveling  to  the  campus  but  also incorporates  the business  rules. </p>
                <p>hese  business  rules  cover  a  wide  range  of  regulations  and  policy  such  as subject per-requisite,   student's   payment   status,   course   coordinator's   decision   and   the correspondence  of  students'  seniority  to  the  intended  enrolling  subjects.  Besides  business rules,  the  system  also  incorporates  various  notification  mechanisms  like  Short  Messaging Service (SMS) and Email. XML is used to store the business rules and thus allow the portability of  the  system  interface  to  wider  range  of devices  such  as  Personal  Device  Assistant  (PDA). </p>
                <p>The  interface  auto-detects  the  user's  device  either  PC/laptop  or  much  smaller  screen  device such  as  PDA.  In  short,  the  enrollment  system back-endengine  runs  based  on  the  business rules and front-end engine runs to provide high satisfaction user experience. With the business and  user  interface,  the  system canrun  the  workflow  of  student  enrollment  from  the  online enrollment  form  to  approval  workflow  cycle  running  parallel  with  the  notification capability.<i><u>(Patrick,  2006)</u></i>.</p>
                <p>Thefinding  and  conclusion  of  this  research  need  to  develop  is  to usethe databases  to  configure  the  differences  of  status  of  students,  it  should  rely  on  the  system  to emphasize  the  common  consequences  and  can  put  the  front-end  and  the  back-end  of  the users.EnrollmentSystem is a system that is usually used in schools. It is necessary to have a system like this in schools. With the use of computers, software can make the work easy. The Enrollment  is  registering  and  managing  the  inputted  information  of  the  enrollee.  In the advancement  of  technology,EnrollmentSystem  is  commonly  used  for  registering,  assessing, billing and scheduling of students. Saint Jude Parish School is an educational institute that was founded in the year 1990. This school has implemented K-12 educational system and because of  this,  the  enrollment  system  has  been  outdated.</p>
                <p>The  enrollment  regarding  the  additional programs  will  be  handled  manually.  The  main  problem  of  this  research  is  that  the  manual process  of  the  school. Lack  of  computerization  is  a waste  of  time  and  effort.  Based  on  Chris Joseph,  doing  a  manual  process  has  high  chances  of  human  error.  The  staffs  might  record mistaken data or duplicate the records.<i><u>(Jeremy, Acel, Karl, Blakewyn, 1990)</u></i>.</p>
                <p>The  finding  and  conclusion  on  this  research areto  change  the  enrollment  system  into  a Computerized  Online  Processing  of  Enrollment  Records,  to  avoid  the  human  error  and  can easily fix the common issues regarding for the student records.</p>
