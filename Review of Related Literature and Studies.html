Those that were also included  in this chapter helps in  familiarizing  information that are relevant and similar to the present study. </p>
 
    <strong>SIMILARITY</strong>
    <p>-With the above mention studies, Enrollment system of Veritas Parochial School used web-based and databases to stores their records. Students will logging on website, register and fill out certain forms. Liceo De Victoria Enrollment was developed and implements using relational databases.  </p>
    <strong>DIFFERENCE</strong>
    <p>-According to Ella (2012), the ideas and concept where the students will check their schedule, view subjects and teachers and set desired changes and pay online.</p>
    <strong>Theoretical Background</strong>
    <p>Enrollment management is “not just an organizational concept: it is both a processand a series of activities  that  involve  the  entire  campus”  (Hossler  &  Bean,  1990).  Dennis  (1998)  defines enrollment  management  as  forecasting  trends  that  will  affect  higher  education  and  utilizing research to plan for the future (Dennis, 1998). Second, Dennis lists the following attributes of those who understand enrollment management. Hossler and Bean conclude that there are two goals of enrollment management. “First, to exert more control over the characteristics of the student body and two control the size of the student body” (& Bean, 1990, p.5) given these two perspectives, one  would  say  that  enrollment  management  is  concerned  with  the  attraction  and  retention  of students (Braxton, Vesper, & Hossler, 1995). Donhardt (1995), feels that enrollment management involves  the  influence  of  the  whole  enrollment  picture  from  recruitment  through  graduation. Bateman  and  Spruill  (1995)  found  that  enrollment  management  extends  to  the  educational outcomes  of  attendance.  Hossler  and  Bean  (1990)  define  enrollment  management as “efforts to influence the characteristics and the size of enrolled student bodies  by directing the activities of the offices of admissions, financial aid, new-student orientation, career planning, retention, and a number  of  other  student  affairs  areas” (Dennis, 1998). Tinto and Russo (1994) report that the success of enrollment management programs has been only moderately successful. In traditional way of enrolling, manual enrollment system is commonly used as a way of enrolling students to and is continuing to be used nowadays. In manual way of registering and enrolling students they must have to fill up first using ball pen and an enrollment form sheet given by their teachers. By the help of different developers and programmers, they have developeddifferent system about the registration  and  enrollment  process.  Computerized,  online  registration  and  online  enrollment systems that helps the school for having an easier process of managing student information.</p>
    <strong>SIMILARITY</strong>
    <p>-Liceo De Victoria Enrollment was developed and implements using relational databases. As for Quiver  (2001),  who  also  developed  a  program  using  database  III  which  capable  of  retrieving, access in manipulating of data in easy way.</p>
    <strong>DIFFERENCE</strong>
    <p>-Gaton (2012), the system allows students to choose courses they want to take with the available class schedules. This allows students to make up their time schedules  for different class courses without time schedule conflicts. </p>

    <p>Based  on  the researcher,  a  web-based  enrollment  system  for  Veritas  Parochial  School  (VPS)  in Web Based enrollment system, Manila was developed to help its students enroll in a more efficient way  without  the  hassles  of  waiting  long  hours  in  filling  out  forms,  which  sometimes  become redundant, or to stand in line and pay at the cashier. It is with the Web-based Enrollment System for  VPS  that  this  new  style  of  enrollment  may  be  achieved.  This  new  type  of  system  offers  its students  new options  for  enrolling  at  VPS.  By  logging  on to  VPS  website, one  can  register  and enroll subjects for a school year. With these, all the students are required to fill out certain forms that do not take more than a few minutes to accomplish. The system stores its records in the school database  for  future  references.  Confirmation  of  the transaction  made  by  the  students  need  to  be verified, the payment of tuition fees must be made in the schools registrar. The students may also browse the web site of VPS and he can check his current account. He canalso refer to the list of the  school  current  tuition  fee  rates  (Pascual  &  Riceo,  2008)  According  to  Lopez  (2005),  a registration  system  helps  and  provides  efficient  and  reliable  services  to the  students,  enrollment personnel and administration. Moreover, this system improved the process of enrollment in terms of searching, retrieving and subject schedules. While  in a study conducted by Cayabyab (2007), many problems and difficulties were  identified  in  the existing system of Dagupan City National High  School  (DCNHS).  These  major  concerns  are  affecting  the  efficient  enrollment  system  of students. Security of the students records were found to be at high risk. The current system may fail to protect some important documents. It has also untimely and inefficientreport generation. A computerized system for DCNHS shall result to a significant increase in the number of enrollee’s Network-Based Enrollment system Conde (2007) in his study entitled “Network-bases Enrollment System  of  Paete  National  High  School  cited that  the  manual  process  of  enrollment  and  manual 
handling  of  information  and  reports  of  the  students  is  very  laborious  one.  The  proponents developed a network based system enrollment system to the said school to solve the huge amount of  task.  Garcia  (2002)created the “LSPC Enrollment System”, the study can be a great help to persons  concerned  during  the  enrollment  period,  the  registrar,  instructor of  the  students  as  they retrieval  necessary  information  when  needed  and  lessen  the  burden  manually  browsing  over enrollment slip for record purposes Saayo et.al (2008) developed the system “Network based automated Enrollment and grading system  for Morong National High School. Due to increasing population  of  the  institution,  and  the  school  currently  implementing  the  manual  system,  every student  spends  a  lot  of  time  during  enrollment  period,  such  as  paying  their  tuition  fees  and processing the school requirements.</p>
    <strong>SIMILARITY</strong>
    <p>-The study of Lumber (2002), which is all about the systematic enrollment process using database in Saint John Academy, helps enrollment process increase its efficiency.</p>
    <strong>SIMILARITY</strong>
    <p>-After the allotted enrollment period, the system runs and assigns slots to students. Both concept and  ideas  does  not  cover the  researchers  system  in  terms  of online  payments  or  computation  of student’s grades, class scheduling, and assessment of fees. </p>

Due to increasing population of the institution, and the school currently implementing the manual system, every student spends a lot of time during enrollment period, such as paying their tuition fees and processing the school requirements. Valina et.al (2009), in this work entitled “Network-based  student  Permanent  Record  keeping  and  Enrollment  System  of  Balian  National High School”.  This System was made to lessen the time and effort exerted by both student and 
school employees. It is also made to give accurate reports and keep records of every students every studentsand for easy and fast way of enrollment. Soria (2006), constructed a system entitled “Network-based Computerized inventory System for the supply office of the LSPC main campus. With the advancement of technology, devices and machines were improve , developed and inverted to cope up with the need of new world. There are different systems designed for reliable, efficient and very useful to the user. Cabang et al. (2003) developed the ‘computerized Students Record Monitoring  System  of  Siniloan  National  High School”,  Computerized  Student  data  will  be exceedingly  helped to the user through continuous  management of the School. It could  help the registrar for a less effort services  in the  institutions especially  in updating, printing and deleting student’s  record.  Velasco  (2002)  Study  entitled  “Maulawin  National  High  School  Student Information System” cited that maintaining students, records manually is a very difficult task and time consuming. In that case, computerization system that can help and handle 17 this data needed to speed up the process of student’s record keeping and to promote and reliability.</p>
