    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <div class="abstract-p">
        <p>The Enrolment System was proposed in replacement of the manual process of enrollment in Mandaue City College for it to have an organized flow of transaction and an ease of work. The study is concerned on how the manual enrolment performs throughout the company’s transaction. The numerous transactions that the manual system covers, such as updating and adding student records, generating the advising and assessment slips, and the like are commending the manual enrolment system to be inefficient for the needs of the institution. Since the study involves proper records handling, tracing the constraints and evaluation of the manual system is essential. Thus, the proponent’s gathered necessary data that will help in the progress of enhancing the existing system. </p>
        <p>Technology has been a great help with various organizations including academic institutions in making transactions easier and faster. Schools have been incorporating information systems that could ease the difficulties on handling large amounts of data and tedious processes. This study focuses on one of the major information systems being used by these academic institutions, the Enrollment System which also includes the assigning of schedule, sectioning of classes, and monitoring of enrollment requirements. The system also utilizes descriptive analytics to provide an accurate enrollment report.</p>
