        <p>Principles  of  information  systems  first  is  to  provide  a  set  core  IS  principles  that  prepare students  to  function  more  efficiently  and  effectively  as  workers,  managers,  decision makers, andorganizational leaders. Second is to provide into the changing role of the IS professional so that the students can better appreciate the role of this key individual. Third, to show the value of the IS discipline as an attractive field of specialization so that the students can evaluate this as a potential career path. <i><u>(Ralph, George,1998)</u></i>. The finding and conclusion of this research areto  develop  our  core  values  to  represent  the  good  mentors  of  our  community;  to  facilitate  and attain  efficient  decision  making.  Principle  of  Information  Systems:  A  Managerial  Approach, Ninth  Edition,  offers  the  traditional  coverage  of  computer  concepts,  but  its  place  the  material when the context meeting business and organizational needs. Placing information system (IS) concepts in this context and taking a general management perspective has always set the text apart from general computer books thus making it appealing not only to MIS majors but also to students  from  other  fields.  The  text is  notoverly  technical,  but  deals  with  the  role  that information systems play in an organization and the key principles a manager needs to grasp to be successful. These principles of IS are brought together and presented in a way that is both understandable and relevant. In addition,the entire  IS  discipline, while giving students a solid foundation  for  further  study  in  advance  IS  courses  as  programming,  system  analysis  and design,  project  management,  database  management,  data  communication,  Web  site  and systems  development,  electronic  commerce  and  mobile  commerce  applications,  and  decision support.  As  such,  it  serves  the  needs  of  both  general  business  students  and  those  who  will become IS professional.</p>
        <p>The overall vision, framework, and pedagogy that made the previous editions so popular have been retained in the ninth edition, offering severalbenefits of students. We continue to present IS concepts with a managerial emphasis. While the fundamental vision of  this  market-leading  text  remains  unchanged,  the  ninth  edition  more  clearly  highlights established  principles  and  draws  out  new  ones  that  have  emerged becauseof  business, organizational,  and  information  change.  Exposing  students  to  fundamental  IS  principles  is  an advantage  for  students  who  do  not  later  return  to  the  discipline  for  advancecourses.  Since most functional areas in business rely on information system, an understanding of IS principles 
        helps student future business function managers employ information systems successfully and avoid  mishaps  that  often  result  in  unfortunate  consequence.  Furthermore,  presenting  IS concepts at the introductory level creates interest among general of the IS students who may later  choose  information  system  a  field  of concentration. <i><u>(Ralph,  George,  2010)</u></i>.</p>
        <p>The  finding and conclusion of this research is to provide a core of IS principles with which business student should  familiar;  to  offer  a  survey  of  the  IS  discipline  that  will  enable  all  business  students  to understand the relationship of IS courses to their curriculum as a whole; present the changing role  of  the  IS  professional;  and  to  show  the  value  off  the  discipline  as  an  attractive  field  of specialization.</p>
