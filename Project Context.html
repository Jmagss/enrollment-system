            Project Context
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>The  present  system  at  the  school,  such  as  the  enrollment  system  and  record  keeping,  is entirely manual. The manual system has been in existence since the school first opened its doors. Students will visit the admissions office throughout the enrollment period to obtain any necessary enrollment requirements. The evaluator will then look at the pupils' grades to see which topics they should  study  this  school  year  and  how  they  are  doing  academically.  The  assessor will  come  up with a list of subjects that the pupils must take. After getting the list, students will pay the cashier their PTA fee and other fees.The cashier will issue receipts to the students as proof that they have 
            already paid. At the end of the enrollment period, the person in charge will prepare a summary of student enrolment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The enrolling officer has to search and locate the student's records in the filing cabinet, the manual  updating  of  the  student's  records  slows  down  the  admission  process.The  assessor  will create a list of required subjects for the pupils to take. After getting the list, students will pay the cashier  their  PTA  fee  as  well  as  any  additional  expenses.  The  cashier  will  issue  receipts  to  the students as proof of payment.At the end of the enrollment period, the person in charge will prepare a summary of student enrolment. Due to disorganized student data, tallying subjects takes time as well.  The  manual  updating  of  the  student's  records  slows  down the  admission  process  since  the enrolling officer must seek and locate the student's records in the filing cabinet. Student evaluations are delayed due to the enrolling officer's need to check previous grades and the fact that some of the student's records have gone missing. Tallying subjects takes time as well, due to unstructured student data.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Due to these  considerations,  the  researchers  decided to  design  and  build  a  computerized enrollment system that is quick, accurate, dependable, and easy to use. The institution's proposed enrollment  process  is  a  positive  step  in  the  right  direction.  This  might  be  a  tremendous  help  to folks who are  juggling a  lot of tasks during the registration period  by providing quick and easy access to information. The main purpose of this capstone project is to develop a computer-based enrollment system that is fast, accurate, dependable, and easy to use.For the School's management, professors,  staff,  and  students,  the  researchers  will  design  and  build  a  capstone  project  titled "Computerized  Enrollment  System."  The  proposed  project  will  use  computer-based  software to replace the school's present manual enrollment system, which will allow authorized users to speed 
            up the enrolling process, provide updated, secure, and easy-to-access student records, and provide accurate reports.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The  proposed  project  will  replace  the  school's  current  manual  enrollment  system  with computer-based  software  that  will  allow  authorized  users  to  speed  up  the  enrolment  process, provide  updated,  secure,  and  easy-to-access  student  records, and  generate  accurate  reports.  The user's log report, list of enrolled students, enrollment summary reports, payments and collectibles, and student ledger are all possible outputs from the proposed project.Admission officers can easily update  student  records,  evaluate  students,  provide  a  list  of  student  subjects,  record  payments, provide  a  list  of  collectibles,  and  manage  credentials  such  as  Form  137,  among  other  benefits provided by the proposed project for school administration, office staff, and students.This project will offer the school with an enrolment database. It will keep track of student information such as name,  year,  section,  timetable,  and  school  fees.  It  might  also  be  used  by  the  school's  finance department to pay for school fees. The database is intended for use by registrar office personnel and other authorized users to enable them to quickly produce information needed by various people in the institution. Enrollment and fee collection for the school will be simple and quick thanks to the database system.</p>
