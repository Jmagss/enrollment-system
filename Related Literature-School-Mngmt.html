            <p>In  open-source  management  of  work  becomes  more  complex.  Work  management involves two dimensions. Management of the processes necessary to perform the work. Management of the execution of the processes. Development of relationship in an open-source  environment  appears  more  difficult  as  individuals  are  working  in  a  different context, and development of a shared understanding of information and communication pattern is less easily achieved. <u><i>(Jan Sandred, 2010)</i></u>. The finding and conclusion of this research  is  to  build  an  open-source  management  process  of  work  and  execution,  the school must organize the workload of School Management properly where the students can  access  the  cleared  information  that  is  more  efficient  to  communicate  of  each respondent. School Management, as a body of educational doctrine, comprises several principles  and  precepts  relating  primarily  to  the  technique  of  classroom procedure  and derived from the practice of successful teachers.</p>
            <p>The writers in the field have interpreted these principles and precepts in numerous ways, usually be reference to larger and more fundamental  principles  of  psychology,  sociology,  and  ethics.  Management  implies  an orderly way of thinking. It describes in operational terms what is to be done, how it is to be done, and how we know when we have done. Management is not an arcane mystique. It is a method of operation. Good management should result in an orderly integration of education  and  society  edited  by  <u><i>(Kulwinder  Pal,  Paul  Monroe,  1913,  Shelley  Umana, 251972)</i></u> </p>
            <p>The finding  and  conclusion  of this  research  it  should  not  be  static; organization needs  continuous  reorganization.  It  should  be  modified  as  when  educational  theory advances, bringing in curricular and other changes. New challenges cannot be met. But changes should be brought about slowly and with consultation and consent. And lastly, the Organizational Charts detailing â€œfunctions, jurisdictions, responsibilities, relationship, limits  of  authority,  objectives  and  methods  of  measuring  performance,  promote  better understanding and larger output.</p>
